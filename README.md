# Step readme generator

[![Step changelog](https://shields.io/github/v/release/bitrise-steplib/steps-readme-generator?include_prereleases&label=changelog&color=blueviolet)](https://github.com/bitrise-steplib/steps-readme-generator/releases)

Generate a `README.md` based on `step.yml` data

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

This step can be used to generate a standard README.md based on step.yml data. The resulting readme will list the step's most important details, such as the description, a table of inputs and outputs, and links for further information.

The exact structure is defined in `README.md.gotemplate`

Additional step-specific content can be included from local Markdown files, such as example usage and information for contributors.

## üß© Get started

Add this step directly to your workflow in the [Bitrise Workflow Editor](https://docs.bitrise.io/en/bitrise-ci/workflows-and-pipelines/steps/adding-steps-to-a-workflow.html).

You can also run this step directly with [Bitrise CLI](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise).

### Examples

A workflow to generate and update `README.md`:

```yaml
generate-readme:
    steps:
    - git::https://github.com/bitrise-steplib/steps-readme-generator.git@main:
        title: Generate README
```

Run the workflow locally by `bitrise run generate-readme`, then commit the generated file.

You can also include step-specific sections in the readme. The following example uses two files stored in the step repo:

```yaml
generate-readme:
    steps:
    - git::https://github.com/bitrise-steplib/steps-readme-generator.git@main:
        title: Generate README
        inputs:
        - example_section: docs/examples.md
        - contrib_section: docs/contributing.md
```

This will read the contents of `docs/examples.md` and `docs/contributing.md`, then include their contents in the final readme.
