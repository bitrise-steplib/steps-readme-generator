  This step can be used to generate a standard README.md based on step.yml data. The resulting readme will list the step's most important details, such as the description, a table of inputs and outputs, and links for further information.

  The exact structure is defined in `README.md.gotemplate`

  Additional step-specific content can be included from local Markdown files, such as example usage and information for contributors.
